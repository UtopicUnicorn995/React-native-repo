create new project: npx create-expo-app@latest

BETTER OPTION FOR ME: create new project: npx create-expo-app app-name --template blank 
start server with tunnel: npx expo start --tunnel
remove boilerplate: npm run reset-project

Text and views are native elements

react native have no CSS
inline styles
Stylesheet Objects


Views components only holds components -> Does not show them

Button component does not have a style prop

styles does not cascade
